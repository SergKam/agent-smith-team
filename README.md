# Agent Smith Team

AI agents workspace in Node.js

## Overview

The Agent Smith Team project is a comprehensive workspace that integrates multiple applications to facilitate task management and AI agent interaction. The project is structured into three main applications:

1. **UI Application**: Admin interface for task management and AI agent interaction.
2. **Task Manager Application**: Backend for managing tasks and users.
3. **Agent Developer**: Tools for AI agent development and testing.

## Ideas for Future Development

1. Implement a microservices architecture for better scalability.
2. Add real-time collaboration features using WebSockets.
3. Integrate machine learning models for task prioritization and resource allocation.
4. Develop a mobile app version for on-the-go task management.
5. Implement a plugin system for extending AI agent capabilities.
6. Add support for multiple languages and localization.
7. Implement advanced analytics and reporting features.
8. Integrate with popular project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello).
9. Develop a CLI tool for interacting with the system.
10. Implement a comprehensive logging and monitoring system.
